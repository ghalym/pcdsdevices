Release History
###############


v3.0.0 (2020-10-07)
===================

API Changes
-----------
- The calculations for `alio_to_theta` and `theta_to_alio` in `ccm.py`
  have been reverted to the old calculations.
- User-facing move functions will not be able to catch the
  :class:`~ophyd.utils.LimitError` exception.  These interactive methods are
  not meant to be used in scans, as that is the role of bluesky.

Features
--------
- :class:`pcdsdevices.attenuator.AT2L0` now has a textual representation of
  filter status, and supports the move interface by way of transmission values.
- :class:`~pcdsdevices.pseudopos.SyncAxes` has been adjusted to support
  scalar-valued pseudopositioners, allowing for more complex devices to be kept
  in lock-step motion.
- :class:`~pcdsdevices.pseudopos.PseudoPositioner` position tuples, when of
  length 1, now support casting to floating point, meaning they can be used
  in many functions which only support floating point values.
- Added signal annotations for auto-generated notepad IOC support.

Device Updates
--------------
- Add event/trigger information to PPM, XPIM.
- Reclassify twincat motor and states error resets as "normal" for
  accessibility.
- Add PMPS maintenance/config PVs class for TwinCAT states devices,
  propagating this to all consumers.

New Devices
-----------
- Adds :class:`~pcdsdevices.lxe.LaserTimingCompensation` (``lxt_ttc``) which
  synchronously moves :class:`LaserTiming` (``lxt``) with
  :class:`~pcdsdevices.lxe.TimeToolDelay` (``txt``) to compensate so that the
  true laser x-ray delay by using the ``lxt``-value and the result of time tool
  data analysis, avoiding double-counting.
- Adds :class:`~pcdsdevices.lxe.TimeToolDelay`, an alias for
  :class:`~pcdsdevices.pseudopos.DelayNewport` with additional contextual
  information and room for future development.
- Add LaserInCoupling device for TMO.
- Add ArrivalTimeMonitor device for TMO.
- Add ReflaserL2SI device for TMO.

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed a typo in a ``ValueError`` exception in
  :meth:`pcdsdevices.state.StatePositioner.check_value`.
- A read-only PV was erroneously marked as read-write in
  :class:`pcdsdevices.gauge.GaugeSerialGPI`, component ``autozero``.
  All other devices were audited, finding no other RBV-related read-only items.
- The direction of :class:`LaserTiming` (``lxt``) was inverted and is now
  fixed.
- Allow setting of :class:`~ophyd.EpicsMotor` limits when unset in the motor
  record (i.e., ``(0, 0)``) when using
  :class:`~pcdsdevices.epics_motor.EpicsMotorInterface`.

Maintenance
-----------
- Added a copy-pastable example to
  :class:`~pcdsdevices.component.UnrelatedComponent` to ease creation of new
  devices.
- Catch :class:`~ophyd.utils.LimitError` in all
  :class:`pcdsdevices.interface.MvInterface` moves, reporting a simple error by
  way of the interface module-level logger.

v2.11.0 (2020-09-21)
===================

API Changes
-----------
- :class:`BaseInterface` no longer inherits from :class:`ophyd.OphydObject`.
- The order of multiple inheritance for many devices using the LCLS-enhanced
  :class:`BaseInterface`, :class:`MvInterface`, and :class:`FltMvInterface` has
  been changed.
- Added :class:`pcdsdevices.interface.TabCompletionHelperClass` to help hold
  tab completion information state and also allow for tab-completion
  customization on a per-instance level.
- :class:`~pcdsdevices.interface.Presets` ``add_hutch`` (and all similar
  ``add_*``) methods no longer require a position.  When unspecified, the
  current position is used.

Features
--------
- For :class:`pcdsdevices.pseudopos.DelayBase`, added
  :meth:`~pcdsdevices.pseudopos.DelayBase.set_current_position` and its related
  component `user_offset`, allowing for custom offsets.
- Epics motors can now have local limits updated per-session, rather than
  only having the option of the EPICS limits. Setting limits attributes will
  update the python limits, putting to the limits PVs will update the limits
  PVs.
- Add PVPositionerDone, a setpoint-only PVPositioner class that is done moving
  immediately. This is not much more useful than just using a PV, but it is
  compatibile with pseudopositioners and has a built-in filter for ignoring
  small moves.
- Moves using mv and umv will log their moves at info level for interactive
  use to keep track of the sessions.
- Add ``user_offset`` to :class:`~pcdsdevices.signal.UnitConversionDerivedSignal`,
  allowing for an arbitrary user offset in user-facing units.
- Add ``user_offset`` signal to the :class:`pcdsdevices.lxe.LaserTiming`, by
  way of :class:`~pcdsdevices.signal.UnitConversionDerivedSignal`, offset
  support.

Device Updates
--------------
- CCM energy limited to the range of 4 to 25 keV
- CCM theta2fine done moving tolerance raised to 0.01
- Beam request default move start tolerance dropped to 5eV

New Devices
-----------
- Add WaveFrontSensorTarget for the wavefront sensor targets (PF1K0, PF1L0).
- Add TwinCATTempSensor for the updated twincat FB with corrected PV pragmas.

Bugfixes
--------
- Adds hints to the :class:`pcdsdevices.lxe.LaserTiming` class for
  ``LiveTable`` support.
- umv will now properly display position and completion status after a move.
- Tab completion for many devices has been fixed. Regression tests have been
  added.
- Fix bug in PulsePickerInOut where it would grab only the first section of
  of the PV instead of the first two
- Tweak will feel less "janky" now and give useful feedback.
- Tweak now accepts + and - as valid inputs for changing the step size.
- Tweak properly clears lines between prints.
- Fix issue where putting to the limits property would update live PVs,
  contrary to the behavior of all other limits attributes in ophyd.
- Fix issue where doing a getattr on the limits properties would fetch
  live PVs, which can cause slowdowns and instabilities.
- Preset methods are now visible when not in engineering mode. (#576)
- Rework BeamEnergyPositioner to be setpoint-only to work properly
  with the behavior of the energy PVs.
- FltMvPositioner.wm will now return numeric values if the position
  value is a tuple. This value is the first element of the tuple, which
  for pseudo positioners is a value that can be passed into move and have
  it do the right thing. This resolves consistency issues and fixes bugs
  where mvr and umvr would fail.
- Fixed a race condition in the EventSequencer device's status objects. Waiting
  on these statuses will now be more reliable.
- Fix issue where converting units could incur time penalties of up to
  7 seconds. This should take around 10ms now.
- Fix bug on beam request where you could not override the tolerance
  via init kwarg, despite docstring's indication.

Maintenance
-----------
- Establish DOC conventions for accumulating release notes from every
  pull request.
- Tweak refactored for maintainability.
- Use more of the built-in ophyd mechanisms for limits rather than
  relying on local overrides.

--------
- ``happi`` entry points have been moved to this library for proper
  modularization.
- Area detectors embedded inside of larger devices have been made
  considerably smaller to improve performance in other applications,
  for example in ``typhos``.

Bugfixes
--------
- Provide ``FakePytmcSignal`` for testing in external libraries. This
  fixes issues with fake devices not working if they contain ``PytmcSignal``
  instances outside of the ``pcdsdevices`` testing suite.
- Fix various issues related to moving to ``ophyd`` ``v1.5.0``.
- This library is now importable on win32.

===================

Features
--------
- Add ``screen`` method to ``PCDSMotorBase`` to open the motor expert screen
- Add tab completion filtering via whitelists as the first feature of the
  ``engineering_mode`` switch. This was implemented because the tab
  completion on ophyd devices is extremely overwhelming.
  Use ``set_engineering_mode(bool)`` to turn ``engineering_mode`` on or off.
  The default is "on", which means "everything is normal".
  Turning ``engineering_mode`` off enables the whitelist filtering,
  and in the future may also have other effects on the user interface.
- Add ``dc_devices`` module for components from the new DC power system.
  This currently contains the ``ICT`` and related classes.

Misc
----
- Fixed a race condition in the tests
- Clean up the Travis CI configuration

- Add ``Acromag`` and ``Mesh`` classes
- Add ``motor`` subdevice to state record devices
- Add ``status`` string to ``BeckhoffAxis``

API Breaks
----------
- State devices no longer have the ``readback`` signal, as it is redundant
  with the new ``motor`` subdevice
- ``PCDSDetector`` has been renamed to ``PCDSAreaDetector`` for clarity.
  ``PCDSDetectorBase`` is also renamed to ``PCDSAreaDetectorBase``.

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix PVs in ``BeckhoffAxis``

- Add ``Motor`` factory function for choosing which motor class to use based
  on the text in the ``prefix``.

Bugfixes
--------
- ``IMS`` class will no longer get its ``.SPG`` field stuck on ``paused`` or
  ``stopped`` when a scan is interrupted. Scans will start even if these
  fields are blocked.
- Update out-of-date ``requirements.txt`` file for ``pip``
- Pin ``matplotlib`` to ``<3`` to avoid import incompatibility pitfalls, and
  confine the ``matplotlib`` imports to function scope instead of module scope
  to avoid having a backend be set on import.

- Added ``DelayStage`` class for laser delay stages
- Added ``SyncAxes`` class for synchronizing axes e.g. tables, ccm
- Added ``keypress`` utilities python2 port
- Added ``wm_update`` python2 port to ``FltMvInterface``. This is essentially a
  ``camonitor``.
- Added ``mv_ginput`` python2 port to ``FltMvInterface``
- Added per-class icons to be picked up by ``lightpath`` and other
  applications

Bugfixes
--------
- Use ``IMAGE2`` instead of ``IMAGE1`` as the area detector default, because
  this is the low rate or binned image. Avoid sending huge images quickly
  through python processes.
- Prevent issue where presets from same-named device would interfere with
  eachother.
- Attenuator subclasses now have sane names
  (previously ``Attenuator1234567``, for example).
- Split the XPP and XCS lodcm foils (they are different).
- Warn the user about using certain classes directly when they need to be
  subclassed.
- Raise errors for any invalid state in a state positioner, not just the
  ``Unknown`` state.
- Add ``SUB_STATE`` subscription types for ``OffsetMirror`` and ``Attenuator``
- Valve interlock had inverted logic

Maintenance
-----------
- Standardize component imports as ``import Component as Cpt``
- Move some interlocks into ``check_value`` instead of ad-hoc locations
- Misc travis fixes and improvements
- State devices are more forgiving with certain inputs
- Clean up the `Slit` interface for ``lightpath``

API Breaks
----------
- Rework and improve various simulated hardware, removing old ``sim`` modules.
- Require some newer modules


v0.8.0 (2018-05-27)
===================

Features
--------
- Added `AvgSignal` class. This can be used when you want to
  run a callback on a rolling average of a ``Signal``. (#227)
- Added an average of the gas detector energy to the `BeamStats` class (#227)
- Implemented motor `.SPG` field from LCLS motor record into PCDSMotorBase (#236)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix a bug where the `LODCM` class had a ``readback`` signal with an invalid PV. (#232)
- Fix a bug where the tests would never pass, ever (#238)

v0.7.0 (2018-05-08)
===================

--------
- Revamp states handling for devices like IPM and XFLS (#205)
- Add a `BeamStats` class (#200)
- Add an `EventSequencer` class (#196)

- Fix a bug where the mirror states were reversed (#215)
- Fix a bug where IMS velocity limits were ignored (#209)

v0.6.0 (2018-04-05)
===================

Features
--------
- Improved documentation (#170)
- Recreated the presets feature from existing hutch_python deployments.
  This allows operators to record the positions of anything that implements
  the `FltMvInterface` to a ``YAML`` file. This helps keep track of various
  important experimental motor positions that are too dynamic to place in EPICS. (#187)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed a rare race condition in the testing suite (#189)

CI
--
- Testing suite now uses the conda-forge build of ophyd instead of NSLS-II lightsource2-tag (#191)

v0.5.0 (2018-03-08)
===================

API Changes
-----------
- The `pcdsdevices.EpicsMotor` has been replaced by
  `pcdsdevices.PCDSMotorBase` and three child classes
  `IMS`, `Newport` and `PMC100`. This is an attempt to have a reasonable MRO
  for the discrepenacies between all our different implementations
  of the EPICS Motor Record (#167)
- Due to the growing complication of the Daq class and related utilities,
  all related functions were moved to `<https://pcdshub.github.io/pcdsdaq>`_ (#168)
